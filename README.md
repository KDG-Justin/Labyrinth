# A Labyrinth game build with -> React + TypeScript + Bootstrap

This is a small game built in just one day, where the goal is to **find the exit of a maze**.  
You control your character using the arrow keys but be careful!  
If you move in the wrong direction, youâ€™ll be sent back to the start.  

ðŸŽ® Can you find the exit just in time?
